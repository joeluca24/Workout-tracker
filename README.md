# Workout-tracker 


Creating workout- tracker app was a step by step process in which I used 
promise based functions to route every javascript file to their coprresponding 
html or api route.
    Once the routes were taken care off I used google developer tools 
    to find out which method each function was using to correct the errors and to slowly
    load more and more off the page up to functionality. Get, Post, and Put methods were used 
    to correct each correspond 304/404 ERROR.

    Connecting the backend and the front end together using the javascript starter code provided
    and added more appropriate variables. Then filed the correct arrays so they work in the form
    insdie workout- tracker.


        Workout-tracker is a fully functionally application that helps track your
        exercises and saves them for later use. It also tells you what workout you did 
        and tracks the results.
